						//Rust is SO CUMBERSOME I can't do ANYTHING without a hundred lines
						//of boilerplate
						//
						//(in other words, i now need to implement dynamic cross-thread setting of
						//event handlers)
						//...or maybe since nothing else is threaded...
						// make a trait for thingies that need to be in the main event loop
						// and implement it?
						// well, in any case, i need more workspaces available
						// so for a bit i will take a break and make myself keybinds for window
						// grouping, then i can merge all the 1-window workspaces with configs for
						// different things open into a single workspace
						//
						// ok i finished with that but fsr the docs say
						// group:groupbar:{text_color_inactive, text_color_locked_active,
						// text_color_locked_inactive} exist but they dont so now im angery since
						// my matugen theme can't have proper text colors over my tab colors
						//
						// ok fine i will go back to coding
						// also i haven't slept since noon but i can't go to sleep because then i
						// will be super tired in 2 hours when i need to be awake so i can go on
						// vacation with my family
